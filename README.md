This program automates transcription. It requires whisper to be installed on your system.

The initial commit works by taking the file path of your target. In the immediate future, I will update the program to iterate through folders.

Following that I will add error management to help anyone that wants to use this.

You can use this file freely. Please credit me, at least in spirit. :)
